# Epidemic-on-Air
Python project with complex networks analysis (air-borne infection dissipation)

The task was to implement a susceptible-infected (SI) disease spreading
model and run it against time-stamped air transport data. Especially, I was investigating how
static network properties can be used to understand disease spreading.
